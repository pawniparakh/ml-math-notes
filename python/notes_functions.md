## Functions

What are default parameters?
 - Default parameters in Python allow you to define a function with default values for its arguments. If no value is provided during the function call, the default value is used.

When to use *args?
- *args is used to call non-keyword arguments. The special syntax *args allows us to pass any number of positional (non-keyword) arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a tuple, which means we can loop through them or use them with built-in functions.

When to use **kwargs?
- **kwargs is used to call keyword arguments. The special syntax **kwargs allows us to pass any number of keyword arguments (arguments in the form key=value). These arguments are collected into a dictionary, where: Keys = argument names & Values = argument values
